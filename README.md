# Robotic_ARDUINO
 


Certainly! Let's break down the explanation of the above project step by step:
1.	Purpose:
•	The project aims to create a robotic system capable of system control using sensors.
•	The system should be able to detect obstacles, measure temperature, and control the motors based on the sensor readings.
2.	Components Used:
•	Arduino board: The brain of the system that controls the overall functionality.
•	Ultrasonic sensor: Used to measure the distance to detect obstacles.
•	Temperature sensor: Used to measure the ambient temperature.
•	Motor driver: Used to control the motors that drive the robot.
3.	Pin Definitions:
•	triggerPin and echoPin: These pins are connected to the ultrasonic sensor to send and receive signals for distance measurement.
•	tempSensorPin: This pin is connected to the analog output of the temperature sensor to read the temperature value.
•	motor1Pin and motor2Pin: These pins are connected to the motor driver to control the motors.
4.	Constants:
•	maxDistance: This constant defines the maximum distance threshold at which an obstacle is considered to be detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
•	tempThreshold: This constant sets the temperature threshold above which the motors will start moving.
5.	Variables:
•	duration and distance: These variables are used to store the duration and calculated distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor.
•	temperature: This variable holds the temperature value read from the temperature sensor.
6.	Setup Function:
•	The setup() function is called once at the beginning of the program to set up initial configurations.
•	It starts the serial communication for debugging purposes using Serial.begin(9600).
•	It sets the pin modes for the ultrasonic sensor, temperature sensor, and motor control pins using pinMode().
7.	Loop Function:
•	The loop() function is the main part of the program that runs repeatedly.
•	It starts by measuring the distance using the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles:
•	It triggers the ultrasonic sensor by setting the trigger pin to LOW for a short duration, then HIGH for 10 microseconds, and finally LOW again.
•	It measures the duration of the echo pulse using pulseIn() to determine the time it takes for the pulse to return to the sensor.
•	It calculates the distance by multiplying the duration by the speed of sound and dividing it by 2.
•	Next, it reads the temperature sensor value by using analogRead() to read the analog input from the temperature sensor pin.
•	The distance and temperature values are printed to the serial monitor for monitoring and debugging purposes.
•	The program then checks if an obstacle is detected within the maximum distance threshold:
•	If the distance is less than or equal to maxDistance, it means an obstacle is detected, and the motors are stopped.
•	If no obstacle is detected, the program checks if the temperature is above the tempThreshold:
•	If the temperature is above the threshold, the motors start moving forward.
•	If the temperature is below the threshold, the motors are stopped.
•	Finally, the program introduces a delay of 100 milliseconds using delay(100) before the next iteration to avoid excessive readings and rapid motor control updates.
8.	Motor Control Functions:
•	The moveForward() function is called when the conditions are met for moving the motors forward. It sets the motor control pins to HIGH, activating the motors and making the robot move forward.
•	The stopMotors() function is called when an obstacle is detected or when the temperature is below the threshold. It sets the motor control pins to LOW, stopping the motors.
This project demonstrates a basic robotic system that uses sensors to control motors based on environmental conditions. It can be further expanded by incorporating additional sensors, implementing more complex control algorithms, or integrating other features based on specific requirements.
